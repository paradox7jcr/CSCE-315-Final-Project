To run this demo you need to first make a local host using either WAMP or XAMP.
  * WAMP: [Download Here] (http://www.wampserver.com/en/#download-wrapper)
  * XAMPP: [Download Here] (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

Copy all of the files from this repo into a folder named: trapd inside of the wamp/www/ directory.

Once the files are copied and your local server of choice is running, go to your web browser and type in: localhost/trapd

You can also host this on c9.io, navigate to the server.js file and enter "node server.js". It will be hosted on your c9 account.
